Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network or ConvNet) is a type of feed-forward artificial network where the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex. The visual cortex has a small region of cells that are sensitive to specific regions of the visual field.
Convolution is a mathematical operation that allows the merging of two sets of information. In the case of CNN, convolution is applied to the input data to filter the information and produce a feature map. This filter is also called a kernel, or feature detector, and its dimensions can be, for example, 3x3.
Refactoring improves the design of software, makes software easier to understand, helps us find bugs and also helps in executing the program faster. There is an additional benefit of refactoring. It changes the way a developer thinks about the implementation when not refactoring.
There are several benefits of refactoring code
Understand the Big Picture. If you have one main method that handles all of the functionality, it's most likely way too long and incredibly complex. ...
Make It Readable For the Next Dev (or Yourself) ...
Keep Maintainability and Upgradeability. ...
Invest in Development Time.
Definition. Refactoring consists of improving the internal structure of an existing program's source code, while preserving its external behavior. The noun “refactoring” refers to one particular behavior-preserving transformation, such as “Extract Method” or “Introduce Parameter.”
Code refactoring makes the entire application more efficient, secure, fast, maintainable, and scalable. It also helps developers to find the hidden bugs and vulnerabilities in the system. In the code refactoring process, you eliminate all the code smell problems.
Flattening is used to convert all the resultant 2-Dimensional arrays from pooled feature maps into a single long continuous linear vector. The flattened matrix is fed as input to the fully connected layer to classify the image.
The flattening step is a refreshingly simple step involved in building a convolutional neural network. It involves taking the pooled feature map that is generated in the pooling step and transforming it into a one-dimensional vector.
Numpy uses NHWC, pytorch uses NCHW, all the conversion seems a bit confusing at times, why does Pytorch use NCHW at the very beginning? I think it was the default format in LuaTorch and I don't know, why this format was preferred over NHWC. However, note that PyTorch has now experimental channels-last support.
NHWC. Another quite popular data format is NHWC, which uses the following offset function: offset_nhwc(n, c, h, w) = n * HWC + h * WC + w * C + c. In this case, the inner-most dimension is channels ( [b:0] ), which is followed by width ( [b:1] ), height ( [b:2] ), and finally batch ( [b:3] ).
In the simple case, the size of the output CNN layer is calculated as “input_size-(filter_size-1)”. For example, if the input image_size is (50,50) and filter is (3,3) then (50-(3–1)) = 48. But the size of the input image of a Convolutional network should not be less than the input, so padding is done.
If individual filters are convolved separately,it will increase the computation time and so its more convenient to use all required filters at a time directly.
The receptive field is a term originally coined by Sherrington (1906) to describe an area of the body surface where a stimulus could elicit a reflex.
For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.
If all strides are 1, then the receptive field will simply be the sum of (kl−1) ( k l − 1 ) over all layers, plus 1, which is simple to see. If the stride is greater than 1 for a particular layer, the region increases proportionally for all layers below that one
Receptive fields are defined portion of space or spatial construct containing units that provide input to a set of units within a corresponding layer. The receptive field is defined by the filter size of a layer within a convolution neural network.

So what actually is the receptive field of a convolutional neural network? Formally, it is the region in the input space that a particular CNN's feature is affected by. More informally, it is the part of a tensor that after convolution results in a feature.
What is the receptive field in deep learning? Similarly, in a deep learning context, the Receptive Field (RF) is defined as the size of the region in the input that produces the feature[3]. Basically, it is a measure of association of an output feature (of any layer) to the input region (patch).
A convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in an activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in an input, such as an image.
Naturally, CNN is designed to learn classification method based on shape information, but we proved that CNN can also learn classification based on color distribution. In our method, we convert the input image to two different color spaces, HSV and CIE Lab, and run it to some CNN architecture.
A convolutional neural net is a structured neural net where the first several layers are sparsely connected in order to process information (usually visual). A feed forward network is defined as having no cycles contained within it. If it has cycles, it is a recurrent neural network.
A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel. The final output of the convolutional layer is a vector.
Convolution is a general purpose filter effect for images. □ Is a matrix applied to an image and a mathematical operation. comprised of integers. □ It works by determining the value of a central pixel by adding the. weighted values of all its neighbors together.
